Corsair Link software seems to be broken after Windows 8.1 update. Fortunately, there is a fix.

. Hit the start menu, and type _"regedit"_ (Registry editor). Right-click it, then choose _"run as administrator"_ to gain the needed privileges.
 . From the left side folder tree, navigate to the following key:
 
 HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB\VID_1B1C&PID_0C04
 
. Navigate to _"Device Parameters"_

. Change the following DWORD values from 1 to 0

 AllowIdleIrpInD3
 DeviceSelectiveSuspended
 EnhancedPowerManagementEnabled
 SelectiveSuspendEnabled

 . Do this for every sub folder inside _"VID_1B1C&PID_0C04"_. In my case, it's just one folder.

. Restart your machine

After restarting, you will notice that the missing LED controls and fan controls are visible again.
